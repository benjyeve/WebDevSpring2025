	After reading the article, one of the main takeaways for me is personalization, especially in the latter few steps. Not all of my clients will have the same reactions or tastes, so it's useful to know how to appeal to all of them, whether it's in the sketches or the final wireframes. Additionally, I liked how the author provides tools that they recommend using. However, although it looks like a good tool to use, it is locked behind a subscription service, so I'd seek alternatives methods to use.
